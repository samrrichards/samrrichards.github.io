This is a simple website that lets users generate randomized answer keys for tests. It's based on a script that I wrote in Python a while back that helped me write vocabulary quizzes while working as an SAT instructor, although I've also added an option to let users generate keys for multiple choice tests. All in all, building this provided a great occasion for me to learn more about jQuery and CSS, as well as the various ways JavaScript can interact with user input on a website!
